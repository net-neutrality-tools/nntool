== Overview

BEREC–the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications–assigned the contract for development, implementation and validation of the Net Neutrality (NN) Reference Measurement System in July 2018.

The system enables the monitoring of the Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) of Internet Access Services (IAS) as well as aspects of traffic management and serves as a reference for regulatory authorities (NRAs). This decision is another important milestone in the harmonization and standardization of broadband testing in Europe.

The objective of the measurement tool is to provide a reference system for monitoring the QoS aspects of IAS, such as speed and delay, as well as aspects of traffic management such as the blocking and throttling of Internet-based applications.

A specific objective is increased levels of harmonization of NN-related IAS measurement metrics and methodology.

In the long term, the BEREC tool could be a platform enabling NRAs to share knowledge, experience and expertise, including providing a basis for further piloting and researching the area of measuring quality of internet access services.

== Structure

=== Libraries

- *nettest-shared*: Contains resources shared with servers, apps, etc.
- *nettest-shared-server*: Contains shared resources for the backend

=== Server Components

- *collector-service*: Server component that receives and stores measurements

== Usage Guide

=== collector-service

The collector-service can be started as standalone Java application as well as deployed to a servlet container (e.g. Tomcat).

- To start the collector on the command line run `./gradlew bootRun` inside the collector-service directory (Starts the embedded server on port 8080).
- To start the collector in an IDE run the main method of the class `at.alladin.nettest.service.collector.CollectorServiceApplication`

Swagger-UI will then be available via `http://localhost:<port>/swagger-ui.html`.
