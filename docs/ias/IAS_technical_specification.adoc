== General
BEREC – the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications – assigned the contract for development, implementation and validation of the Net Neutrality (NN) Reference Measurement System in July 2018.

The system enables the monitoring of the Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) of Internet Access Services (IAS) as well as aspects of traffic management and serves as a reference for regulatory authorities (NRAs). This decision is another important milestone in the harmonization and standardization of broadband testing in Europe.

The objective of the measurement tool is to provide a reference system for monitoring the QoS aspects of IAS, such as speed and delay, as well as aspects of traffic management such as the blocking and throttling of Internet-based applications.

A specific objective is increased levels of harmonization of NN-related IAS measurement metrics and methodology.

In the long term, the BEREC tool could be a platform enabling NRAs to share knowledge, experience and expertise, including providing a basis for further piloting and researching the area of measuring quality of internet access services.

== Assessment Methodology

=== Measuring Internet access service quality

==== IAS download speed measurements
In the module of IAS download speed measurement, the specifications of the BEREC Net Neutrality Regulatory Assessment Methodology (BoR (17) 178) are implemented as part of the reference measurement system. The following description defines the software methods and settings according to the given methodology.

The frequently used Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used on top of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to represent a realistic user situation.
In order to establish an end-to-end data connection between Measurement Agent and Data Reference Peer, the load generating application data is transferred via WebSocket connections in the case of a Browser of Apple iOS App measurement. In the case of Android App, the load generating application data is transferred via HTTP connections.

To minimize the influence of the congestion control characteristics of TCP and to reduce limitations by the bandwidth-delay product of a single TCP stream, several parallel HTTP / WebSocket data streams are initiated, which transmit sufficient test data from the data reference peer to the measurement agent. For this purpose, a random and large enough amount of data is continuously provided on the data reference peer during the measurement. +
Furthermore a 3 second slow start phase is performed at the beginning of the measurement, starting after the connection setup of the streams. During this time, until the end of the measurement, test data are transmitted over all streams. The transition between the slow start phase and the measurement phase is seamless. There is no need for a new data request from client to server within the streams (compare to BoR (17) 178 Chap 3.1.1).
The data transmission of all data streams is terminated after a specified time of 10 seconds, subsequent to the 3 second slow start phase.

The RFC 6455 specifies that application data is transmitted as sequences of frames (data frames) within WebSocket connections. Different data sizes of WebSocket frame are used, depending on connection speed under test, to ensure adequate performance on client side when using different software components (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
To ensure compatibility, the data are transmitted in opcode “Binary Frame” (WebSocket Frame type) format.

Depending on connection speed under test, the following measurement parameters are used for browser and iOS download measurements:
[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
|Speed class
|Streams
|Frame-size
|low
|4
|2048
|default
|4
|32768
|high
|4
|524288
|very high
|8
|524288
|===

The speed classes mentioned above are defined below.
[cols=2*,options=header]
|===
|Speed class
|Speed
|low
|< 1.05 Mbit/s
|default
|0.95 - 525 Mbit/s
|high
|475 - 1050 Mbit/s
|very high
|950 - 9000 Mbit/s
|===

For the detection of corresponding parameters of a measurement, the default setting is used at the start. The automatic selection of the speed class is done with an analysis of the current data transmission rate after the end of the slow start phase. If the measured throughput rate at this point are outside the currently selected speed class, the settings are adjusted to the next higher or lower speed class. The slow start phase is executed again and a second check of the speed class takes place at the end of the phase.
If the measured throughput rate at this point is outside the currently selected speed class (bps < LB OR bps > UB), the settings are adjusted to the next lower, respective higher, speed class. The connections are terminated and the slow start phase is executed again, repeating the aforementioned steps. If the measured throughput rate at the end of the slow start phase is in the range of the currently selected speed class (bps > LB and bps < UB), the measurement continues until the defined end. A speed class change can be performed at most n=2 times: the third tested speed class will be continued until the defined end, regardless of the configured Lower and Upper boundaries. Additionally, a re-use of a previously tested speed class within one measurement is not possible to prevent speed class bouncing. In case of Android, no speed classes are necessary, as native stream-based TCP sockets are used.

The download time is the time from the start of the last HTTP connection including the effects of the TCP Congestion Control to the first termination time of the parallel HTTP / WebSocket data transfer. The download time is the period during which all parallel HTTP (WebSockets) connections generate load.

The use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) in form of HTTPS or WebSocket Secure (WebSocket over HTTPS) is optional possible. WebSocket Secure brings a positive effect in connection with existing intermediate proxy services. On the other hand, this method generates an inaccuracy of throughput calculation, because the TLS overhead cannot be clearly determined on application level.

==== IAS upload speed measurements
In the module of IAS upload speed measurement, the specifications of the BEREC Net Neutrality Regulatory Assessment Methodology (BoR (17) 178) are implemented as part of the reference measurement system. The following description defines the software methods and settings according to the given methodology.

For this purpose, a random and large enough amount of data is generated in front of the measurement on agent side. +
Furthermore a 3 second slow start phase is performed at the beginning of the measurement, starting after the connection setup of the streams. During this time, until the end of the measurement, test data are transmitted over all streams. The transition between the slow start phase and the measurement phase is seamless.

The data transmission of all data streams is terminated after a specified time of 10 seconds. When determining the time period, the effects of TCP Congestion Control are taken into account with a 3 second slow start phase.
To ensure compatibility, the data are transmitted in opcode “Text Frame” (WebSocket Frame type) format.

Depending on connection speed under test, the following measurement parameters are used for browser upload measurements:

The upload time is the time from the start of the last HTTP connection including the effects of the TCP Congestion Control (slow start) until the arrival of the first TCP packet or WebSocket frame beyond the defined upload duration of the parallel HTTP connectios. The upload time is the period during which all parallel HTTP / WebSockets connections generate load.

The use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) in form of HTTPS or WebSocket Secure (WebSocket over HTTPS) is optional possible. WebSocket Secure brings a positive effect in connection with existing intermediate proxy services. On the other hand, this method generates an inaccuracy of throughput calculation, because the TLS overhead cannot be clearly determined on application level.

==== Calculating speed based on TCP payload
When calculating the data transmission rate, the received data of all parallel streams are determined over the defined measurement period and related to the measurement duration.

The data transmission rates are determined on receiver side. In the case of a download measurement on the part of the measurement agent and in the case of an upload measurement on the part of the data reference peer.

When determining the throughput, the total data volume of all streams, excluding the slow start, of the HTTP Payload or WebSocket Payload including the WebSocket Header are taken into account over the duration of the measurement. This data amount is the TCP payload of the data transfer at application level.
Only completely received WebSocket frames are considered within the measurement, since only these can be evaluated at application level. The WebSocket header is included in the calculation with a dynamic data size per WebSocket frame according to RFC 6455.

The WebSocket frame size should therefore be chosen in a well-balanced way in order to avoid an insufficient throughput determination (only completely received WebSocket Frames are taken into account) on one hand, and to guarantee a sufficiently good performance on the agent side (each WebSocket Frame generates Browser processing time) on the other hand. For this reason, the aforementioned speed classes and speed class change algorithms are used.

HTTP headers, which are transmitted at the beginning of the connection, do not play a role in this calculation, since they are transmitted during the slow start phase (compare to BoR (17) 178 Chap 3.1.2).

If the measured throughput rate, at the end of the measurement, is outside of the used speed class boundaries, this measurement is marked as out-of-bounds.

==== Delay and delay variation measurements
To determine the round-trip time (RTT), the WebSocket Ping Frame type format is used due to security limitations in Web browsers. The RTT measurement is performed by the data reference peer on an request of a measurement agent using the already established WebSocket connection (including TCP / HTTP). The runtime is measured from the sending of the WebSocket Ping to the response from the agent to the peer using the defined Pong response.

10 Ping requests are performed. The median, average, minimum, maximum and population standard deviation values are determined.

=== Detecting traffic management practices that impact individual applications

==== Blocked ports - Web-Browser
The assessment method BoR (17) 178 describes the test of blocked ports as a functional test in which the establishment of a connection between two units is tested. Connections can be tested using different protocols: IPv4 or IPv6, TCP or UDP.

As part of this implementation, browser-based port tests are available using the UDP protocol. The test is initiated by the measurtement agent and can be performed via IPv4 as well as IPv6.
For the usage of UDP in a browser, the WebRTC protocol is used, which enables peer-to-peer communication in modern browsers, e.g. for multimedia communication. In this context, WebRTC offers the use of Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN), which is defined in RFC 5766. This is an advanced feature of Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN).

In this test case, the measurment agent acts as a TURN client, which requests an allocation to a measurement peer, in this context a TURN server. This process takes place in four communication steps as defined in RFC 5766 and shown below.

image::images/IAS_blocked_ports.png[align="center",title="UDP port blocking Test - Web-Browser"]

The test of a UDP port is evaluated as a successful connection if all four defined messages were exchanged within a defined time and the "Allocate success response"-Message contains a valid Relay Address (measurement peer address).

The ports to be tested are configurable, all using the TURN allocation technique described above. The tested ports are usually assigned to a well known service. The following ports are tested in a default setup.

[cols=2*,options=header]

|IPSec NAT Traversal
