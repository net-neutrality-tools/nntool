The android application module can be found in the `android-app` directory.

== Prerequisites

* Android Studio >= 3
* Linux, macOS or Windows
* gstreamer binaries (see below for further info)

When building from the android studio IDE, the following steps are recommended:

* Open the settings menu (ctrl + alt + s)
* Select: "Appearance and Behaviour" -> "System Settings" -> "Android Sdk"
* Select the "Sdk Tools" tab
* Make sure Cmake, NDK and LLDB are installed (have a checkmark next to them)

Enabling gstreamer support for the alternative audio streaming test:

* Go to https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/#android
* Download the tarball, containing the binaries for the supported architectures
* Extract the tarball at a location of you choice
* Write the extracted location into the gstAndroidRoot variable in the gradle.properties file
(the root is the folder where the architectures sub-folders are located, i.e. the arm64, armv7, x86, x86_64 folders)

The ninja build system and all prerequisites of the ias-cpp module are required.
Execute `apt install ninja-build golang lcov libssl-dev`.

Before running the application, it is recommended to set up both the controller and the collector service.

== Controller service settings

Providing information about the controller service - needed to establish a communication between the application and the service - can be done in the Android resource file: `res/values/defaults_controller.xml`

Following options are available:

[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
|Option name
|Value type
|Purpose

|`default_controller_host`
|string
|Controller service host name (e.g. `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`)

|`default_controller_port`
|integer
|The port the controller service is listening on (e.g. `8080`)

|`default_controller_connection_is_encrypted`
|bool
|If set to true, the connection to the controller will be encrypted (HTTPS), otherwise it will be a plain-text connection (HTTP)

|`default_controller_path_prefix`
|string
|Path prefix used to generate different controller service URLs (default: `/`)
|===

== Collector service settings

Usually all measurements initiated with the LMAP protocol should/will contain information on how to reach a specific collector service. The settings provided by the controller can be overriden by editing the Android resource file: `res/values/defaults_collector.xml`. Additionally default values are also provided using this configuration file.

Following options are available:

[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
|Option name
|Value type
|Purpose

|`default_collector_settings_override`
|bool
|If this flag is set to `true`, provided collector service URLs will be overriden by the settings inside this file.

|`default_collector_host`
|string
|Collector service host name (e.g. `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`)

|`default_collector_port`
|integer
|The port the collector service is listening on (e.g. `8080`)

|`default_collector_connection_is_encrypted`
|bool
|If set to true, the connection to the collector will be encrypted (HTTPS), otherwise it will be a plain-text connection (HTTP)

|`default_collector_path_prefix`
|string
|Path prefix used to generate different collector service URLs (default: `/`)
