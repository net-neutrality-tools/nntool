Linux (any Version)

- make or ninja
- cmake
- g++
- libssl-dev
- lcov

=== Build

With fullfilled prerequisites perform the following steps:

[source,bash]
----
cd <nntool_eu_directory>/ias-cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. # add -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="DEBUG" for debug build, add -GNinja for ninja
make # or ninja
----

=== Unit Tests

To execute the included unit tests execute the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
cd <nntool_eu_directory>/ias-cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="DEBUG"
ninja
./ias_client_test
----

To generate the code coverage reports run the following commands after running the unit tests:

[source,bash]
----
lcov --capture --directory . --output-file coverage.info
lcov --remove coverage.info '/usr/*' --output-file coverage.info
lcov --remove coverage.info '*external/*' --output-file coverage.info
lcov --remove coverage.info '*ias-libnntool/*' --output-file coverage.info
genhtml coverage.info --branch-coverage --output-directory ./coverage_report/
lcov --list coverage.info
----

The HTML code coverage report will be generated into directory `ias-cpp/build/coverage_report`.

== Demo Parameters

Modify *src/iasclient.cpp* according to Code-Documentation to edit measurement parameters before *Build*
