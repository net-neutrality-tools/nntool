 * <li>Calls appendString() whenever new output exists, could be sent to
 * different views.
 * <li>Calls increaseProgress() when a work step has been finished.
 * <li>Calls onFailure() when test failed, to leave an interface for some
 * platform-specific debug methods or just output some failure messages.
 * <li>Calls submitData() to pass the result variable into the main activity for
 * later reference (in email app, etc.).
 * <li>Calls onEndTest() to finish the test.
